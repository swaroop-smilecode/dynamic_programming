### Problem:
Write a function, summing_squares, that takes a target number as an argument. The function should return the </br>
minimum number of perfect squares that sum to the target. A perfect square is a number of the form (i*i) where i >= 1.</br> 
For example: 1, 4, 9, 16 are perfect squares, but 8 is not perfect square.
### Solution:
<ins>What is perfect square?</ins></br>
We can create a perfect square number by taking a positive number and multiplying it with itself.</br>
For example; here the perfect square numbers are `1`, `4`, `9` & `16`.</br>
1 * 1 = 1</br>
2 * 2 = 4</br>
3 * 3 = 9</br>
4 * 4 = 16</br>
<ins>Let's understand the question with the help of an example:</ins></br>
Minimum number of perfect squares that are needed to form number `12` are `3`</br>
4 + 4 + 4</br>
You can also form `12` as below, but it's not the minimum number of perfect squares.</br>
9 + 1 + 1 + 1</br>
