This transition from 9 to 7 is no good.</br>

So, you need to add more information to the decision tree, so that it helps in taking the decision more properly.</br>

And, whats the final answer?
Question is about the longest sub sequence & you know that you satred taking the elements of the sequence along the edges, right?</br>
So, if you pick up the path with many edges, that is the longest sub sequence.

### Approach
So, now our approach is to logically implement this tree using recursion & then consider that path</br>
which has most number of edges.
