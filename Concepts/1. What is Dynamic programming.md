### What is Dynamic programming?
Again, the word `dynamically` tells us about what is dynamic programming.</br>
In this technique, instead of finding soluiton to each sub problem, will store the sub problem results in memory</br>
& use those results to derive the final answer. 

Storing the sub problem results can be done in 2 ways.
1. If you implement the solution using recursion, you no need to store the results explicitly.</br>
   Underneath stack mechanism will take care of this. In this approach, will start with bigger problem</br>
   which is asked in the question & proceed towards the smallest problem for which you know the answer.</br>
   That's why it is called as `top-down approach`.
2. In this approach, you need to store the results explicitly using either `1D list` / `2D list(matrix)`.</br>
   Will start with smallest problem for which you know the answer & then proceed towards the biggeer</br>
   problem asked in the question.</br>
   That's why it is called as `bottom-up approach`.
